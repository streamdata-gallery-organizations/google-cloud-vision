description: Google Cloud Vision API enables developers to understand the content
  of an image by encapsulating powerful machine learning models in an easy to use
  REST API. It quickly classifies images into thousands of categories (e.g., sailboat,
  lion, Eiffel Tower), detects individual objects and faces within images, and finds
  and reads printed words contained within images. You can build metadata on your
  image catalog, moderate offensive content, or enable new marketing scenarios through
  image sentiment analysis. Analyze images uploaded in the request or integrate with
  your image storage on Google Cloud Storage.
